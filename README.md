Recommended to browse the web for malicious EML files or text files and safely download in a sandboxed enviornment and run the script to test the accuracy of detection.
There is plently option online on other websites.
Python 3. + is okay for this script.
Get your paid Open AI api key on their website or you can borrow a friends but an api key is necessary for this script to function.
I also atatched a harmless email text file to prove it will be detected as harmless by my python script
